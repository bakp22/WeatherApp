# WeatherApp
To run, open Xcode, pick an iPhone model and press the "play" triangle button.
How I made this app was a combination of implementing UIkit programmatically in xcode using Swift. Additionally, I utilize tomorrow.io to gain API information through the API call: weather realtime. The rest was a combination of finding resources online to understand how to complete the assignment and crack any obstacles along the way.
